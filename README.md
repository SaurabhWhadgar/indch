<p>In 2012, Anopheles stephensi, a malaria vector prevalent in South Asia, was identified as the cause of severe malaria in Djibouti City, Horn of Africa, revealing the expansion range of this vector to emerging urban settings. The fitness of An. stephensi to inner urban settings is reported to be a direct consequence of the vector adapting to laying eggs in over-head water tanks, when street-side water puddles are often polluted by oil and sewer. Here, we report the assembly of a strain of An. stephensi of the type-form, collected from a construction site from Annanagar, Chennai (IndCh) as recently as 2016. The assembly of IndCh reported here completes the genome trilogy of three possible genotypes of a 16 Mbp inversion in the middle of the 2R arm of An. stephensi, 2Rb, associated with adaptation such as insecticides, climate and behavioral. The other two strains of An. stephensi, UCI and STE2, with high-quality genomes reported in 2020 complement the 2Rb genotype with respect to IndCh. The UCI strain is homozygous for the 2Rb chromosome inversion (2Rb/2Rb), the STE2 strain is heterozygous (2R+b/2Rb) and IndCh is homozygous for the standard form of the 2Rb configuration (2R+b/2R+b). Comparative genome analysis allowed fine-mapping of the 2Rb locus in An. stephensi, and the complementarity enabled characterization of the 2Rb breakpoints at the sequence level, enabling for the first time, the identification of tens of thousands of segregating SNPs demonstrating that one third of both wild and laboratory populations maintains a heterozygous genotype of 2Rb. We discuss the extent of divergence of this locus in IndCh using structural and mutational changes relative to the UCI genome of opposite 2Rb configuration. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the IndCh strain is significantly similar to individuals from diverse populations in India compared to the other two strains, and argue that the IndCh genome is more relevant and better suited as a reference for malaria management in urban settings.</p>
